  <!-- Ghidra's patternconstraints.xml doesn't seem support merging/amending patterns. It only
      seems to allow one pattern file per language constraint, so it tries to overwrite instead of merge.
      This leads to a weird error: Attempted to overwrite property value for patternfile in contraint node: /languageID = 68000:BE:*:*.
      So we instead provide a constraint ONLY for the Mac variant provided by this extension.
